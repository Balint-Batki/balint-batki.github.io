I aim to contribute to the safe operation of current and future nuclear reactors by utilizing my experience in reactor physics and thermal-hydraulics while also integrating novel machine learning techniques to improve and extend the present methods in this field.

Currently I am working as a Postdoc at the Intitute for Energy Technology (IFE) in Norway. Previously, I was a researcher at Centre for Energy Research (CER) in Hungary. I got my PhD in Physics from the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME).

I have had several side projects realated to machine learning, such as developing an automated invoice processing system and building a data-driven flood prediction model for the Tisza River.

This site showcases some of my work and personal projects.
