	abstract = {Machine learning models have been developed to predict properties of spent nuclear fuel assemblies from Paks NPP, such as burnup, cooling time, initial enrichment, and Pu-239 content. Measured gamma spectra are processed, and activity ratios of fission products are calculated to serve as input features for Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, and Multi-Layer Perceptron models. Data uncertainty is considered during inference to produce prediction intervals, and input features are ranked using the Gini importance of Random Forest models. A deep learning approach using Convolutional Neural Networks has also been developed to predict the spent fuel parameters from the measured spectra directly. The new models can predict spent fuel parameters with great precision, outperforming earlier approaches that rely on nonlinear regression using a single feature to predict burnup and cooling time and can estimate initial enrichment and Pu-239 content.},

	abstract = {This paper deals with group constant parameterization, a necessary step to utilize the results of assembly-level neutronics calculations at the full-core level. The focus is on low sample size problems when the commonly used linear interpolation approach is inadequate, a typical situation of using Monte Carlo codes for group constant generation. This work presents a newly developed code package for automated group constant parameterization. It implements several machine learning regression models − including a novel polynomial regression algorithm − performs hyperparameter optimization and selects the best model based on a detailed evaluation. The applicability of the new code package is demonstrated in a case study for a VVER-1200 fuel assembly covering both normal operation and transient conditions. In this example, the novel polynomial regression model provides a 73 pcm average error in kinf that leads to reactivity coefficients well within the desired precision.},

Therefore, we aimed to test machine learning algorithms to make 7-day ahead forecasts, choose the best-performing model, and compare it with the actual DLCM.},

The static cases of fuel loading and first criticality, control rod worth, void, subassembly swap, temperature reactivity measurements, as well as the dynamic cases of rod drop transients were investigated. A new reactivity curve smoothing method was implemented in the nodal code to eliminate the cusping effect due to the movement of the absorber. The excellent agreement between the KIKO3DMG calculation, the CEFR experimental measurement, and the reference Serpent Monte Carlo calculation results validates the KIKO3DMG code on a fast reactor for the first time.},

We show that the coupled code can simulate an asymmetrical control assembly withdrawal transient. The code provides adequate results by using 6-group constants instead of the widely used 24-group constants, and with this, the computation time of the transient is reduced by 95%. Moreover, we drove attention to the applicability of the point-kinetics methodology, which can be limited because of the approximate manner of the derivation of the corresponding parameters. Finally, we present a methodology to flatten the distribution of the outlet coolant temperature by applying flow restrictors.},

A new axial expansion module was developed for the KIKO3DMG, which introduces mixed nodes. The theoretical background and a new method of group constant mixing are described. Weighting the group constants with the volume ratios is appropriate for small, non-absorber nodes, if the inverses of the diffusion coefficients are weighted instead of the diffusion coefficients. Group constants were generated for the ALLEGRO helium-cooled fast reactor using the Serpent Monte Carlo code and applied in the KIKO3DMG. The effect of the group constant parameterization was investigated on the power distribution and the coefficients of reactivity. The axial and radial power distribution and the fuel, cladding and wrapper temperature coefficients of reactivity and the void coefficient of reactivity were calculated with good accuracy in the KIKO3DMG.},

	abstract = {The calculation of the essential core safety parameters in fast spectrum reactors are loaded with large uncertainties due to the particularly large uncertainty of nuclear data, modelling uncertainties and possible mistakes by users. These core safety parameters such as coefficients of reactivity, power peaking factors and point-kinetics parameters play an important role during unprotected transients. The contributions to the uncertainties of the target parameters (e.g. peak cladding temperature) from the core safety parameters can be determined by uncertainty and sensitivity analyses. Three-dimensional models of the ALLEGRO (demonstrator gas-cooled fast reactor) and a sodium-cooled fast reactor (SFR) concept were created in the Serpent Monte Carlo code, and several coefficients of reactivity were calculated. Furthermore, thermal hydraulic analyses with point kinetics were made for the selected transients by the ATHLET code system. An unprotected loss of flow and an unprotected overpower transient were studied at first using the best estimate approach to understand the behaviour of the reactors in these scenarios. In addition, uncertainty analyses were performed applying the GRS method, considering the uncertainties of the coefficients of reactivity, which were taken from benchmark results. Finally, the importance of the uncertain parameters was determined from sensitivity measurement. The results show that the thermal expansion of the core structural elements has a significant effect on the reactivity of these fast spectrum reactors. Moreover, it was found that during unprotected overpower transients the most important uncertain parameters are the Doppler coefficient and the fuel thermal expansion coefficient of reactivity. In addition, the large uncertainty of the positive coolant and cladding temperature coefficients of reactivity have a significant influence on the uncertainty of the calculated peak cladding temperature, especially in the case of unprotected loss of flow transients. The results imply that the uncertainty of some core safety parameters should be reduced. Lastly, the results adumbrate that additional safety shutdown systems are to be applied to mitigate the consequences of unprotected transients.},
