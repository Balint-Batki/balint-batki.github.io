Here's a glimpse into our approach:  üîç Data Processing: Measured gamma spectra are analyzed, and activity ratios of fission products are calculated to serve as input features.  ü§ñ Models Deployed: Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, and Multi-Layer Perceptron models are used, considering data uncertainty during inference to produce prediction intervals. Input features are ranked using the Gini importance from Random Forest models.  üåü Deep Learning Innovation: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model has been developed to predict spent fuel parameters directly from the measured spectra.  üí° Results: These new models significantly outperform previous methods, which relied on nonlinear regression using a single feature.

It is revealed that the KIKO3DMG/ATHLET provides good results by using 6-group constants instead of the widely used 24-group constants, and with this, the computation time of the transient is reduced by 95%. By comparative analysis, it is found that the point-kinetics approach underestimates the assembly-wise peak temperatures nearby the withdrawn control assembly during the investigated transient due to the fixed power distribution and the lack of spatial reactivity effects."},{"name":"Extension and application of the KIKO3DMG nodal code for fast reactor core analyses","publisher":"Annals of Nuclear Energy","releaseDate":"2020-01-09","website":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anucene.2019.107295","summary":"A new methodology for modeling the non-uniform axial thermal expansion of fuel with the KIKO3DMG is developed by introducing small mixed nodes.

The uncertainties of the most important selected core safety parameters originated from possible user effects, modeling uncertainties, and nuclear data uncertainties are taken into account. The ATHLET code with point-kinetics methodology is used. It is found that the peak cladding temperature is sensitive to all the selected uncertain core safety parameters during the ULOF transient. During the UTOP transient, the Doppler and the fuel thermal expansion reactivity coefficients are the dominant factors. It is shown that the peak cladding temperature reaches unacceptable levels during the UTOP transient initiated by a potential 1$ reactivity insertion, which adumbrates that additional safety shutdown systems are to be applied to mitigate the consequences of reactivity transients."}],"skills":[{"name":"Machine Learning","level":"","keywords":["PyTorch","Tensorflow","Time Series Forecasting"]},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering","level":"PhD","keywords":["Reactor Physics","Monte Carlo Simulation","Nuclear Safety","Thermal-hydraulics"]},{"name":"Physics","level":"","keywords":["Research"]},{"name":"Programming","level":"","keywords":["Python, C++"]}],"languages":[{"language":"English","fluency":"Professional working proficiency"},{"language":"Hungarian","fluency":"Native or bilingual proficiency"},{"language":"Russian","fluency":"Elementary proficiency"}]}
